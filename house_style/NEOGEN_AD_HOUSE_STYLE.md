# NEOGEN JOB ADVERT – HOUSE STYLE

**Goal:** A concise, inclusive advert that explains the role’s impact, what the person will do, what they’ll bring, and how to apply — in Neogen’s voice.

**Voice & Tone:** Professional, clear, inclusive, and human. Avoid jargon. Short sentences. UK/US spelling should match the location (if provided). Keep it positive and specific.

**Structure (in order):**
1. **Role Title** (H1)
2. **Opening Hook** – 2–3 sentences describing the role’s purpose/impact at Neogen (avoid listing tasks here).
3. **Work Model / Location** – one sentence (e.g., *This role follows a hybrid model…* or *Remote/On-site in <City/Country>*).
4. **What you’ll do** (H2) – 6–10 bullet points, action-led, outcome-aware. Avoid duplicating requirements here.
5. **What you’ll bring** (H2) – 6–10 bullet points of skills/experience (mix of must-haves and nice-to-haves). Keep bias-aware, avoid degree inflation.
6. **How to apply** – one short sentence inviting applications via the Apply button.
7. **Hashtags / tags** if applicable (e.g., `#LI-Remote`).

**Formatting:**
- Use Markdown headings (H1/H2) and bullet lists (`- `).
- Use parallel grammar for bullets (start with verbs for “What you’ll do”; nouns/skills for “What you’ll bring”).
- Prefer present tense; avoid internal system names unless essential.

**Length guidance:**
- Opening Hook: 40–70 words
- Each bullet: 8–18 words
- Overall: ~250–450 words (adjust by “Detail” slider)

**Examples of headings:**
- H1: “Senior Quality Engineer”
- H2: “What you’ll do”
- H2: “What you’ll bring”
